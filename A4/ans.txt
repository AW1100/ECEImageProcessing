No, because the background points seleted between different groups are not exactly the same. They are chosen manually by mice clicking.

Yes, it's working correctly. By observing the plot in 1c, there are 6 obvious peaks. These peaks are the rice grains' pixels at column 50, and the rest are background pixels. We can see the gray level of background pixels in levelled image is much lower than original image.

2c.
By observation, the rice grain size is around 26 x 9 pixels. The block size(M x N) we pick is 10 x 10 because it wouldn't fall into the rice grain entirely and also small enough to cover as many pixels as possible. We also test block size up to 25 x 25, and the results are not much difference.
